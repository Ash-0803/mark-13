## Palindromic Birth
- Palindromic Birth is a logic heavy application which challenged me a lot while learning javascript.
- First it inputs the date of birth and check if it is a palindrome or not in 6 different formats.
- **Challenges :**
  - The really buggy part was to check the nearest palindrome date to the date of birth entered by the user.
  - Once I finally debugged the functionality of finding the nearest palindrome date in the future.
  - One more bug came my way while doing the same but in the past and comparing it to the future date and comparing which is nearest.
- Managing these two functionalities together was a big challenge for me that took me a lot of time to figure out the answer.
- The commit history can answer what changes I made to resolve the issues I faced. Overall it was quite learning.
